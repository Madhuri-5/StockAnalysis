# Stock Market Analysis
### Analyze stock market using Python

This is a collaborative space for ITExperience mentees to build their portfolios and sharpen programming skills. 

### Objective:

For this project, collaborators will be utilziing the Python programming language to analyze data from the stock market available through Yahoo Finance. The main objective is to provide practise for the Python programming language. 

As this is an open source project, the actual outcome of what the coding exercise generates remains open ended and will naturally conform to the interests of the different collaborators within this project.

### Project Information:

The main source of stock data will be Yahoo Finance. Python library for pulling stock data from Yahoo is [`YFinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance "YFinance Documentation"). This will be used along with other common Python libraries of choice for plotting and analysis of data.

### How to Join This Project:

To contribute to this project, you will need to [`create a free GitHub account`](https://github.com/join "Join GitHub") if don't already have one. 

Once you have an account, go to the [`ITExperience/StockAnalysis repository`](https://github.com/itexperienceincacc/StockAnalysis "ITExperience Repo") and **_"FORK"_** the repository to your own GitHub account. Please follow the useful tips in the links below on how to **_"FORK"_** and colloborate on GitHub. **One thing to note** about the video guide, before you add your edits, be sure to **_"CLONE"_** and get the latest version fo the code. Afterwards, you can write your code and **_"COMMIT"_** all from Google Colab.

The main Python script for this project is located [`here`](https://github.com/itexperienceincacc/StockAnalysis/blob/Development/StockMarketAnalysis.ipynb). It is a Google Colab notebook. Click the "Open in Colab" button, make your contributions/changes. When you are done making changes to the code, go to the File menu -> "Save a copy in Github". Then save to the **_"forked repository"_** on your GitHub account that you already created. Type up a few words describing the changes you are making to the code.

**ENJOY PYTHON!**
